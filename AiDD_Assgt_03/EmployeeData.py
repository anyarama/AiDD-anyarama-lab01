# This module is intentionally small and boring (as good data layers should be).
# It only knows how to serialize/deserialize our Model objects to/from a CSV file.
# No business logic, no user interaction. The Controller orchestrates when to call these functions.
#
# CSV schema decision:
# - We'll include a 'role' column to distinguish Employee vs Manager when we load.
# - Columns: role,id,fname,lname,department,phNumber,team_size
#   For plain Employee rows, team_size will be empty. For Manager rows, team_size will be an integer string.
#
# Behavior:
# - load_employees(csv_path): returns a list of Employee/Manager objects. Skips malformed rows with a warning.
# - save_employees(csv_path, employees): overwrites file with current list snapshot.

Reflections â€” EmployeeData.py (Data layer)

Prompts and intent:
- I asked Copilot for two functions: load_employees and save_employees using a role column to round-trip Manager vs Employee.
- I specified that the data layer must not contain UI or business rules.

What Copilot proposed vs. what I kept:
- It suggested a simple DictReader/DictWriter pattern. I kept that and added logging for skipped rows.
- I used team_size as the Manager-only field and wrote empty string for Employees so the CSV stays uniform.

What I learned:
- Round-tripping polymorphic types through a simple "role" column keeps the CSV flat and easy to debug.
- All validation still happens inside the model; the data layer just surfaces errors and moves on.
